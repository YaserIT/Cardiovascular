Description
This repository provides the complete MATLAB implementation of an integrated predictive modeling framework based on multi-objective metaheuristic optimization
for feature selection and classification. The proposed framework combines several population-based optimization algorithms with classical machine learning
classifiers to improve predictive performance while reducing feature dimensionality. The system is designed for reproducible experimentation and comparative
evaluation of optimization-based feature selection strategies.

AI Application Category (PeerJ Computer Science)
This work is categorized as an AI Application according to PeerJ Computer Science guidelines. The study focuses on the practical application
of artificial intelligence and computational intelligence techniques, particularly metaheuristic optimization and supervised learning,
to enhance predictive accuracy in a real-world biomedical classification task.

Dataset Information
The experiments are conducted using the UCI Heart Disease dataset, which is publicly available and widely used in clinical decision support research.

Description: The dataset contains clinical and demographic attributes for heart disease diagnosis, represented as a feature matrix D and corresponding class labels C.
The dataset is preprocessed and stored in the file total.mat, which includes:
D: Feature matrix
C: Class labels

Code Information
The MATLAB code implements a multi-stage pipeline consisting of:
Data loading and preparation
Multi-objective feature selection
Classification and prediction
Performance evaluation and visualization
Implemented Feature Selection Algorithms
Multi-Objective Artificial Bee Colony (MOABC)
Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA)
Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO)
Multi-Objective Grey Wolf Optimizer (MOGWO)
Each optimizer searches for an optimal subset of features by balancing classification performance and feature reduction.

Implemented Classifiers
k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Neural Network (NN)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Naive Bayes (NB)

Methodology
Feature Selection
Feature selection is formulated as a binary optimization problem, where each candidate solution represents a subset of features.
A threshold-based mechanism converts continuous optimizer outputs into binary selections. Fitness evaluation is performed using k-fold cross-validation on a hold-out validation set.

Classification
Selected features are used to train classifiers on the training data. Predictions are generated for unseen test samples to assess generalization performance.

Assessment Metrics
The following evaluation metrics are used and justified due to their suitability for imbalanced and medical classification problems:
Accuracy: Overall correctness of predictions
Recall (Sensitivity): Ability to correctly identify positive cases
Precision: Reliability of positive predictions
F-measure: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
AUC (Area Under ROC Curve): Discriminative capability across thresholds
MSE (Mean Squared Error): Prediction error magnitude
These metrics are computed using repeated random test sampling to ensure robustness.
