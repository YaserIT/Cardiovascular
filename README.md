# Cardiovascular
This repository contains research-oriented implementations and experimental code related to cardiovascular data analysis, modeling, and intelligent diagnostic systems. The materials provided here are intended to support reproducibility, methodological transparency, and further investigation in cardiovascular machine learning and computational health research.

The repository primarily hosts code accompanying scientific publications authored by Yahya Dorostkar Navaei and Yasar Ahangari Nanehkaran. The implementations reflect the methods, experiments, and evaluation frameworks described in their respective studies.

This resource is designed for researchers, graduate students, practitioners, and reviewers in scientific journals interested in cardiovascular analytics, data-driven healthcare, and applied machine learning.
